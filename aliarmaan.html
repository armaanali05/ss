        <p> I was born on 18 of januray in 2006. I belong to one of the small cites in punjab, indua from Moga. Form that day the begins when i cried and my family smile.
           My family always suported me in everything whatever i wanna do they ony said one thing just do it.
           After 4 years i jioned my school st.joseph's convent school.
           I am beonging form a middle class family.
           i have a joint family with 8 members in it.
           i am the younger one.
            I have three elder sisters.
        Time spends 7years spend fully wasted nothing enjoy in life.
        People says that when god gives he gives everything.
        That year was my luckiest year. Made new friends who became the closest friend.
        Life has one rule every one comes for a difinate purpose in your life.
        Many people will come and go form but the true one will always standing behind you they will never care about the  damm condition.
        One of my mentor said work for six moths without any distractio after that you will observe that you have came 10 years front form the rest of your mates.
        the formula of 100% sucess is 1% luck, 1% talent anfd 98% never give up what evr the damm condition happens in life.
        I belive in one thing work when the ohters are enjoy after few years live like how the enjoying people are dreaming to live.
        if someone said you; you can't do it then you have to do it.
        The people who laughed at ay tou failure they must also present at the time of your greatest sucess.
